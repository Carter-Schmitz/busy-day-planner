# busy-day-planner

A day planner to plan for activities in a typical 9 to 5 workday. The time blocks contain an input field that are saved to local storage when the accompanying save button is pressed. The time blocks also change color based on whether they are in the past, present, or the future from the current time. The meat of this application comes from three functions working in tandem. One to compare the current hour from moment to the hour id tags assigned to each timeblock. Another to save the text of the input field to local storage when the sibling save button is pressed. And one to display the current day/time. The biggest challenge in this project was working through the logic of assigning id tags to the blocks that could then be used for if else statements. Which also required me to split the actual id tags themselves to have a clean number for comparison.
